# Virtual Events Guide 2020

Hello everyone! 


Welcome to the AI4Good Lab. We are thrilled to have you this year with us and looking forward to spending the next two months with you.


When the COVID-19 crisis hit Canada in mid-March, we quickly decided to move the program to a virtual format. To ensure a smooth and productive program for all involved, we are providing a virtual guide to ensure clear communication and positive interactions. 


With the decision to switch to an all-online format, Zoom meetings and web-based 3D spaces will be used to host all Lab activities. We are planning to have all original content planned for the AI4Good Lab 2020 in an online format: lectures, talks, workshops, Industry Night and Demo Day. And not least of all, we are planning social activities in 3D spaces and online formats to provide other ways for participants to meet, socialize, and get to know each other.
All attendees are expected to follow the posted Code of Conduct for the event. We will not tolerate inappropriate behavior online, any more than we would at an in-person event.


We will maintain the original schedule, as closely as we can. While this is a much grander experiment than we’d planned to run, we look forward to you joining us to make it successful.


The systems we are using for the online conference include Zoom, Slack, and Mozilla Hubs. The main activities will be organized in Zoom and large networking activities will be organized in 3D virtual spaces hosted in Hubs. Hubs is web-based and runs in traditional browsers on most devices, and supports VR via WebVR. We are creating tutorial content to help people learn to use the system, and will host learning sessions in the week before the event to help people prepare.



**1. Code of Conduct**


AI4Good Lab 2020 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. As a program that aims to share ideas and freedom of thought and expression, it is essential that the program takes place in an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person by being respectful of all. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the program. If you wish to report a breach of the code of conduct this can be done via email to Program Manager, Yosra Kazemi (ykazemi [at] ai4goodlab.com), and/or Executive Director, Maya Marcus Sells ( mmarcussells [at] ai4goodlab.com). All reports will only be sent to the authorized people and will be treated confidentially.

**3. Slack Rules for all Channels**

- **DO NOT**  upload assignments and work documents in the slack channels. You may upload them in the appropriate Google Drive folder
- Be nice! We are all here to learn and help each other out
- Please remember that your community engagement counts towards your stipend consideration.


**4. Main point of contact**

Please contact us on slack before resorting to email.

- If the first letter of your last name is between A-H, your main contact is Christina Isaicu (cisaicu@ai4goodlab.com)
- If the first letter of your last name is between K-Z, your main contact is Karine Séguin (kseguin@ai4goodlab.com)


**5. Zoom lectures, talks, and workshops**

For all lectures, talks and workshops that are running during the program, the Zoom platform will be used. You can access the rooms via the link provided in the Curriculum schedule.

- Please install the latest version of the Zoom desktop application on your computer.
- Upon your arrival you will be waiting in the waiting room until the host accepts your request. This is our way of checking the attendance.
- Do not share the link with anyone outside of the program.
- All the lectures will be recorded. You will have access to the videos, slides, and exercises via Google Drive. 
- Do not share the program material with anyone outside of the program.
- Please note that even though Zoom has the private chat option, the Host can have access to the content of those conversations, and all chat records will be available in the recordings. 

**6. TA-dedicated hours**


To have better access to your TAs, each study-group has a dedicated TA with whom you will be working for the duration of the curriculum period (June 8th - July 7th). 


There are dedicated hours in the schedule to spend with your TA and have hands-on advice working on the exercises related to the lectures. There are also time slots in the schedule for you to practice on your own or with your team without your TA.


Every participant is expected to spend a certain number of hours per week working with their team and TA. Every group has the freedom to schedule these times around the schedules of the group members, as long as they adhere to the required number of hours per week, and feel they are advancing well in the curriculum.


In the following section we introduce you to some platforms that you can use to communicate with your teammates during the program. These are just recommendations and you are free to use any other platform that is not mentioned below and you are more comfortable with.


**7. Group Interaction Solutions and Interactive Coding**


Here are some platforms you can use during the program to interact with your team and have a better time working on your projects.


- **Zoom Meetings:** Due to pandemic Zoom removed the 40 minutes time limitation for personal meetings. It is a great platform to video call your teammate, share your screen, and virtual whiteboard your code and interact with each other.
- **Google Hangouts:** Google hangouts and google education is a great way to connect with your group via video calls. You can use Google Jumbo Board to share a white board with your team and exchange ideas. You can also use google drive to share your data, code and any other documents.
- **Skype:** It is a free platform that allows you to call your team and interact with them. However, unlike Zoom you won’t have access to the virtual whiteboard.
- **Google Colab:** Great web-based platform to  share your codes and projects with your team. Everyone can collaborate at the same time on the same project.
- **GitHub:** Another great platform to share your code. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
- **Slack:** You can also use slack to communicate with your group. Each group has their own slack channel that they can use to talk about their projects. However, if you would like to share anything interesting that you think everyone in the program might be interested in or might benefit from, feel free to share that in the Cohort-2020 channel.
