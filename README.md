# AI4Good Lab Code of Conduct


AI4Good Lab 2020 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. As a program that aims to share ideas and freedom of thought and expression, it is essential that the program takes place in an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person by being respectful of all. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the program. If you wish to report a breach of the code of conduct this can be done via email to Program Manager, Yosra Kazemi (ykazemi [at] ai4goodlab.com), and/or Executive Director, Maya Marcus Sells ( mmarcussells [at] ai4goodlab.com). All reports will only be sent to the authorized people and will be treated confidentially.
